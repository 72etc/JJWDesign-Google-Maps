Notes Specifically for SugarCRM On-Demand Users

Google Maps v2.0.7+ - Installs on SugarCRM On-Demand

August 22, 2013 - by Jeff Walters - JJWDesign Google Maps

I'm happy to announce that the JJWDesign Google Maps Package v2.0.7+ now 
installs effortlessly on SugarCRM On-Demand. The project package now passes the 
Package Scanner and File Scanner requirements to allow it to install on SugarCRM 
On-Demand. You no longer need the assistance of SugarCRM Support to install this 
package, yet you will still need SugarCRM Support assistance to uninstall older 
versions of this package.

Support:

This projects tries to support all version of SugarCRM, including SugarCRM 
OnDemand. This package is only tested on SugarCRM CE versions, but it has been 
developed to work with all versions. There may be moments when the SugarCRM 
OnDemand version is ahead of the Community Edition (CE). If you experience any 
issues please report them as soon as possible.

Google Maps API - Request Limits:

Also note that SugarCRM On-Demand is a share hosting environment. The Google 
Maps API is limited by requests per IP address. Therefor, the Google Maps API 
request limits may be exceeded more often than expected.
