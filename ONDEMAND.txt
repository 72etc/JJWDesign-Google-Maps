Notes Specifically for SugarCRM On-Demand Users

Support:

This projects tries to support all version of SugarCRM, including SugarCRM 
OnDemand. This package is only tested on SugarCRM CE versions, but it has been 
developed to work with all versions. There may be moments when the SugarCRM 
OnDemand version is ahead of the Community Edition (CE). If you experience any 
issues please report them as soon as possible.

Package Scanner and Known Issues:

$GLOBALS[‘sugar_config’][‘moduleInstaller’][‘packageScan’] = true;

SugarCRM OnDemand installer runs with package scanner turned on. This can cause 
known problems when installing this package. There are several PNG files within 
this package that may be mistaken as PHP code. They are not PHP code and are 
needed by the maps. In order to bypass the package scanner restrictions you will 
need to open a Case with SugarCRM Support in order to install this package.

Google Maps API - Request Limits:

Also note that SugarCRM On-Demand is a share hosting environment. The Google 
Maps API is limited by requests per IP address. Therefor, the Google Maps API 
request limits may be exceeded more often than expected.
